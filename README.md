## Group 07

### Projects
#### TP00: Introduction to Data Analysis
Utilizing [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), this Python project assesses Pokemon capture outcomes by considering diverse parameters and Pokeball selections. Through simulations and Plotly-generated graphs, it analyzes factors like Pokemon health, level, and ball efficacy, offering insights into optimal capture strategies.

#### TP01: Sokoban Puzzle Solver with Search Methods
This project revolves around the creation of a [Sokoban puzzle](http://www.game-sokoban.com/) solver through the implementation of various search algorithms, including BFS, DFS, Greedy and A*, while using admissible heuristics to optimize solution strategies.

#### TP02: RPG Character Optimization with Genetic Algorithms
This project is dedicated to optimizing character configurations for a role-playing game (RPG) using genetic algorithms. Characters belong to four distinct classes: Warriors, Archers, Defenders, and Assassins, each with specific performance objectives for attack and defense.
<br> The genetic algorithm implementation includes various genetic operators (crossover and mutation), selection and replacement strategies, and termination criteria. All algorithm parameters are specified in an external configuration file for flexibility and experimentation.
